- "This damn dog! At first he bites me and now this?" 
  
  He takes a deep breath.
  
  "Do you have proof for your accusations?"
  
  You think for a moment. If you tell [[Mark]] the truth about you talking to [[Wuffy]] he will think you are completely crazy. You have to find another way. "No actually I can't proof it yet. But if I can proof it I will return."
  
  [[Mark]] eyes you with suspicion and there is an awkward moment of silence. He cleares his throat and then continues: "Well if you find any proof bring it straight to me! If it is true what you are saying and [[Dwori]] is feeding Wuffy indeed so much then I am afraid they both have to suffer the consequences for this treachery. Here take this key it gives you access to the stern room on the lower decks to the chamber where [[Wuffy]] is currently locked in. That should help you investigate the matter further."

				- [[Wuffys meal: Mark cannot believe what you are telling him about Dwori and his dog Wuffy. If it is true that Dwori feeds Wuffy that much and you can proof it to Mark he will have to punish Dwori for his treachery. There are already not enough food supplies on the ship and with Wuffy munching away the rest of them you could never make it back to the capital without restocking your supplies.]]
