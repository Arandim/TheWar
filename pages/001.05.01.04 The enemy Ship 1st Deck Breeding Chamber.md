- You pull the door handle and almost vomit on the floor. An unbearable stench of blood and decay hits you hard. You have no words to describe the scene in front of you. Hell... this is what it must look like. There is blood everywhere that slowly runs towards a drainage in the middle of the room. Inside these pools of blood are eggs made from a sort of meaty cartilege material. From time to time they rattle and move as if the being inside of them wanted to get out of its shell. This must be a breeding room for the Meatbugs Dimitry was talking about. You keep looking around...
