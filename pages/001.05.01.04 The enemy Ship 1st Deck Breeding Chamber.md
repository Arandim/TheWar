Hell... this is what it must look like. There is blood everywhere that slowly runs towards a drainage in the middle of the room. Inside these pools of blood are eggs made from a sort of meaty cartilege material. From time to time they rattle and move as if the being inside of them wanted to get out of its shell. This must be a breeding room for the Meatbugs Dimitry was talking about. Your eyes follow the trail of blood and you can spot your fallen comrades lying there on the drainage grating. Most likely they are to become food for the next generation of Meatbugs Dimitry is breeding here. Disgusting! You decide to...
