- You cast the spell and the scroll disintegrades in your hands. The elvish woman starts shivering as the ice begins to smelt away. "Wha…aa…tt ha..ppeened?" Her teeth are chattering.
  
  You explain everything to her and inform her about your pursuers. She seems pretty unimpressed by the glooming threat of a fight. 
  
  "May they come! We shall give them hell. But better enter a fight prepared and win than to stumble in foolheartedly and get killed. The day of our defeat in front of the gates of [[Arx]] should be a lesson for all of us. You said you are still preparing for the fight? Maybe this can help you." 
  
  She hands you a small piece of parchment with a couple of sketches drawn on it. "Follow the instructions and you should get some pretty handy arrows. If you don't need them feel free to hand them over before we fight. I can make good use of them. I will have a look upstairs and have a talk with the General concerning how we should take on the upcoming fight. By the way my name is [[Eva]]."
