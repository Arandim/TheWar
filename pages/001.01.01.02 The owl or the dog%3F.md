- You open the shrieking door and enter a small dark room with three doors. On your right hand side you hear the damped whining of a dog through a heavy oaken door with a small window that is secured with iron bars. Straight in front of you is a very similar door and you can hear a silent "Shuhuuu, Shuhuuu..." and the fluttering of wings. Besides that you can make out a silent crackling sound as if lightning was captured inside the room. The door to your left must lead to the rear of the ship and possibly to the upper deck.
	- 1. You turn to your right. You want to investigate the room with the whining dog.
