- With a quick flick of the wrist you fling the smoke grenade towards [[Mr. Shuhu]] . But right before you threw the grenade [[Mr. Shuhu]] just looked up and straight in you eyes. You can only see what looks like an explosion which is completely engulfed by the smoke. As you run forward you catch a small bulb which seems to fall directly into your hands and you are able to grab a couple of feathers that are falling down. 
  
  As the smoke lifts you can't see [[Mr. Shuhu]] any more. You hear a dull Shuuu… Shuhuuu… coming from the room with all the bunks in the middle of the lower deck. It would seem that [[Mr. Shuhu]] settled for a more quite place for now.
