- "Well I see you are finished with the preperations for the fight. I hope we will be strong enough to defeat them. Now we have to make a big decision. [[Sara]] can you take the wheel for a second? Come with me we have to discuss how we approach the battle and also how we are to survive the journey ahead of us."
  
  You follow [[Mark]] to the table below the captains deck. [[Mark]] unfolds a big world map.
  
  "We are currently on the [[Royal Passage]] traveling along the coast of [[Rivellon]]. We had to take the long route around the southern cap of the continent, otherwise we would have encountered even more enemy vessels patroling in this area.
  
  He points to the west at the [[Golden Ocean]] that surrounds [[Arx]].
  
  "The [[Golden Ocean]] is heavily patrolled by enemy battleships. Especially this close to [[Arx]], the capital of Lord Mandirs' newly established despotate. Not to mention [[Fort Joy]]. Our sources indicate this particular island is where [[Lord Mandir]] often resides when he is not in [[Arx]]. Now you know why we travel on the [[Royal Passage]]... and still there is an enemy ship in pursuit.
  
  The good news are that we have enough food to make it back to the capital without stopping for a resupply. That is of course if we survive tomorrow."
  
  And this is the most pressing of matters of course. We have to decide how we will face the enemy. I think we have two options. We could try and board the enemy ship with part of the crew in stealth while I will try to distract them. Or we could stay on our own ship and prepare the battlefield in advance. If we decide to board their ship stealthily there is always the risk of getting caught in the process which would render the boarding party defenseless and that would lead to a harder battle. If we manage to succeed however, we take the enemies by surprise and that would make up for our bad equipement and our most likely lesser numbers. If we decide to stay on our own ship we can set up a nasty surprise for them. If I am not mistaken there are a couple of ooze barrels in the cargo hold below decks that we could use. How do you think we should proceed?"
- 1. "Let's board their ship silently and give them a surprise they won't forget."
