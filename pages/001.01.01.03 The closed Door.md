- You peak through the locked door and you can see a lizard woman sitting on a chair completely turned into stone like a statue. You recognize the glowing wands hanging from her belt and you come to the conclusiun that she must be a mage. The table she is sitting at is overflowing with notes, books and maps.
  
  Next to her is a skinny dog wagging his tail. In the back of the room you can make out a lot of blood and corpses of dead soldiers. Suddenly you remember the battle you fought. You can't remember why you fought and where but you know that you are a soldier and these corpses and the petrified woman over there must be your unlucky fellow comrades.
	- 1. Call out for the dog. "Come here doggy!"
