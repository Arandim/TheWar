- "Bees!? Dammit I thought [[John]] took care of them. Well at least last time he threw a [[Poison Cloud Grenade]] in the storage room and that took care of them for a few months as it would seem. Not to mention the delicious honey they left behind. Well [[John]] was struck by a terrible illness a few hours after the battle. I fear that they have poisoned him somehow. [[Sara]] our healer does not know the cause of his illness and cannot treat him. If you could heal him I am sure he can help you to get rid of those bees."
