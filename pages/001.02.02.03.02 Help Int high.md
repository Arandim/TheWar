- You run to the operating table and signal the healer with a shout that her patient is dying. She looks up from her work and you can tell by the confused look she gives you that she was indeed completely focused on the operation and wasn't aware that her patient has stopped breathing. 
  
  You slam your fist on the patients chest in order to revive him. He opens his eyes at once staring into the sky and starts to breathe again. The healer stands next to you completely stunned and unable to do anything. She is completely overwhelmed by the situation. Suddenly the warriors' eyes fixate you and he stammers through the blood coming out of his mouth:
  
  "M…My b….aaag! My lii…ffee ihhss ihh…nnnssside the bahhhg. Don't let it die… Argghh!"
  
  The bloodstream coming out of his mouth intensifies and he gasps for air. His desperate panting for air intensifies and he starts coughing up lots of coagulated blood. He keeps fighting and gargles up more and more blood. The young doctor is completely frozen and doesn't move a muscle. She must be in shock.
	- 1. She has obviously no clue what she is doing! Clear his throat of the blood.
