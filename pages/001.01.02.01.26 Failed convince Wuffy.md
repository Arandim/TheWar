- "[[Wuffy]] can't allow the human to touch them even if it meant our survival! [[Wuffy]] has seen how the enemy treat the wounded and dead. We are no better then them if we do not honor them."
  
  "What have you seen [[Wuffy]]?"
  
  "[[Wuffy]] watched the battle secretly from far away and he saw the terrible might of these red coats. They are beasts! And after the battle they went through the battlefield and killed every last one. They did not show any mercy at all! 
  
  They looted the dead and then burned them all in a huge pile. Those who could still walk would be shackled in iron and put to work as slaves most probably. No no no... Wuuuuuf! [[Wuffy]] does not want to be like that! If we become like them then why do we even fight against them?"
