- You have clearly caught the embassador by surprise. "Ähhmm but how…? I mean… clearly this ship can not be part of a country can it? A floating embassy? Well what did I expect from you humans… of course you would be the first to attempt such an outrageousness. And the audacity to claim everything that is on board it as well… Chapeau! I bow before your skills as a diplomat." 
  
  He gestures a small bow of respect. "Take the Essence with you then. He leans in a little bit and signals you to come closer. He starts to whisper in your ear: "Don't tell anybody I allowed this! If they find out I will be executed on sight. Do not try to take the other Water Essences that may be washed upon this ship by force because it will anger our people!" He leans back again and smiles at you. May I ask for your permission to stay a little while longer on board this ship? I just want to learn from your people. You seem to have mastered the art of diplomacy."
