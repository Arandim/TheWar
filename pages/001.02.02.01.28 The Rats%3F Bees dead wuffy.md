- "Rats you say? Well I have expected it. [[Mr. Shuhu]] normally takes care of them but lately he is always that tired. I mean he is old that is out of the question but this time it is somehow different. Well about the rats. If you can manage to kill them fine by me. As they are very slim creatures and it could prove rather difficult to kill them I suggest as an alternative you could restore Mr. Shuhus old hunting spirit and he takes care of these rats for you."
