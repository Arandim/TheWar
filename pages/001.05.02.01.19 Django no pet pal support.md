- Pierres' attention drifts away after a couple of minutes and in an opportune moment you try to lure the rat to you. The rat must have misinterpreted your signal completely because it runs straight towards the lever in front of your cell. It jumps up and activates it. The lock in your prison door clicks and before Pierre can react the rat is already swallowed by the shadows and out of sight. You slowly push the door open and you fixate the knife lying on a table next to Pierre. Pierre catches your gaze. You know its you or him. There is no other way.
