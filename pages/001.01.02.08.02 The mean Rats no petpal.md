- You keep watching the rats from the shadows. They begin to skreak and it seems as if they are communicating with each other. Whatever they might say it does not seem to be very friendly. One of them must have found what appears to be a rotten human fingerbone that it starts to swallow in whole. Whatever these rats are doing down here you are sure that they will most likely kill and eat you on the spot if they had the chance to do so.
	- 1. You are sure that these rats want to kill you. Either you sneak past them and avoid a fight for now or you surprise them and kill them now.
