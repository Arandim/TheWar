- How to survive with a bow:
  While the others always focus on fighting the enemy close up I prefer to take my shots from as far away as possible. If I can find myself a good hiding spot as high as possible I can deal massive damage. In order to follow in my footsteps all you need is a bow and a little bit of finesse and wits. 
  
  Over the years I perfected the art of crafting bows with as little resources as possible. All you need is a short stick and a bowstring.
  
  I prefer bows over crossbows because you are able to move faster and it is also easier to hit your enemies where they least expect it dealing much more damage. That's why the bow is my weapon of choice.
