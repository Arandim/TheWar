- How to survive with a bow:
  While the others always focus on fighting the enemy close up I prefer to take my shots from as far away as possible. If I can find myself a good hiding spot as high as possible I can deal massive damage. In order to follow in my footsteps all you need is a bow and a little bit of finesse and wits. 
  
  Over the years I perfected the art of crafting bows with as little resources as possible. All you need is a short stick and a bowstring. Now the short stick is the easy part, but the bowstring is harder to come by. In order to produce a bowstring you start with two hairs that you wave into each other. By doing so you receive thread. Take five threads and weave them together to get sinew. Now take two strands of sinew and weave them together and you should get a nice and strong bowstring.
  
  I prefer bows over crossbows because you are able to move faster and it is also easier to hit your enemies where they least expect it dealing much more damage. That's why the bow is my weapon of choice.
