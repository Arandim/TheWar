- The dog turns to you and lets out a happy bark. Then he runs towards the locked door. He stands directly in front of the door and tilts his head to the left and barks: 
  
  "Wuuufff! [[Wuffy]] sad. [[Wuffy]] starving. Human here to free [[Wuffy]]? Human here to feed [[Wuffy]]?"
  
  You can't believe what is happening. You can understand every word the dog is barking.
