- You have searched every corner of your cell. Apart from some useless junk you can't find anything that could help you escape from this place. Pierre still sits upright on his stool, trying to ignore you as good as he can. You can make out a small movement in the shadows at the top of the stairs where Dimitry and Clover left the cabin. There! There was definitly a rat. Maybe it can help you escape.+
- 1. Wait a couple of minutes, then focus your attention on the rat and try to call out to it.
