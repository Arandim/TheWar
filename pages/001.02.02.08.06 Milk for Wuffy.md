- [[Shaun]] does not answer you for a very long time. It appears as if he is thinking hard but he just cannot find a solution. You can almost follow every step of his thinking process and then his face clears up again. Apparently he found a solution.
  
  "Let us make a deal! Although I like [[Wuffy]] I also respect the wish of [[Shaunella]] so I would say it is just fair that you help me first before you get her milk what do you say?"
  
  "That does not sound like you respect the wishes of [[Shaunella]] at all but ok fair enough…"
  
  "Määähhh!" He bleats angrily! "That doesn't matter now. I do not expect you to follow every step of my superior intelligent thoughts! What does matter however is the task I am about to give you. It is quite simple: Get rid of the rats! If you can manage that they do not touch my food stash again I will tell [[Shaunella]] that you are allowed to milk her. Hell I would even let you clean my food stash over there and let you dispose of that weird glowing thing."
  
  "Well I don't have another choice I guess!"
