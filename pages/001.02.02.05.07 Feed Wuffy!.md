- [[Dwori]] extends his right arm somwhere in your direction. "Thank you! Friend! I will never forget that. I will repay the debt I promise!"
  
  You take his hand and shake it. "No problem [[Dwori]]! But first of all I have to find out how to cook everything on your list... thank me once [[Wuffy]] is not starving anymore."
  
  You feel the strong hand of [[Dwori]] as he is shaking yours. He has truly suffered on that battlefield and this favour really seems to lighten up his spirits. After a long handshake you free yourself from his grip and leave.
