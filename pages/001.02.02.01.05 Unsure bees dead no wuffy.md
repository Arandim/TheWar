- "I understand completely why you still can't remember a thing! We have lost everything on that day! Some were lucky and survived but still had to pay a terrible prize. I assume you have seen the maimed survivers on the lower deck? They suffered a terrible fate." He pauses for a moment and you can tell by the look on his face that the fate his soldiers had to endure makes him suffer in a way you can't yet completely understand.
  
  "But where are my manners, not introducing myself. My name is [[Mark]] I am [[General]] of the [[First Legion]]. You can't remember anything you say? Maybe it's better that way."
  
  You feel his eyes mustering you from head to toe. He stops at your forearm and extends his free hand to grab your completely swolen arm. He turns it in order to see the number that is tatooed there. 
  
  "III.II.V!" he reads the numbers out loud and looks straight into your eyes. As you do not react at all he lets go of your arm and sighs: "Dear lord they got you good. I don't know if it's the bees' poison or a side effect of you being unconscious for almost a week now. You can't even remember that your legion is tattooed on your forearm? It means you were in the [[Third Legion]]. Second cohort. Fifth Century. As far as I know you suffered heavy casualties holding the frontline. The last bastion of hope. I thought [[Third Legion]] was completely wiped out... you are lucky to be alive!"
