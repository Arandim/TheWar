- "Ah you mean [[Wuffy]]. Well he is Dworisâ€¦ I mean our cooks dog. I had to lock him away since he bit me out of the blue when we returned from the battle. Poor [[Dwori]] suffered a terrible fate even though he is alive. He got blinded by a powerfull lightning spell shot directly into his face. 
  
  I don't know how he managed to survive that. I would be terrified if magic that powerfull would have hit me. Maybe you can talk to him and ask him how he is doing. Sara our healer is completely overwhelmed by all the patients she has lost already and could need some help!"
