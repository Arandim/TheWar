- You cast the spell on [[Dwori]] and a light tone as if someone banged on a gong really hard. A light appears above the dwarf and his eye begins to focus you. He jumps up and you don't recognize the frightend pale dwarf he was before. He seems to have gained all his strength back. "YOU!" He looks straight into your eyes. "Have you killed my dog?"
  
  "I did! If I would not have done it he would have munched away our last supplies!"
