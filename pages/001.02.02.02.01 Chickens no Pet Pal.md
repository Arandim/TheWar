  When you try to reach into the hen house the two hens attack you and start to hack at your arm with their sharp beaks. To make things worse they are joined by a big rooster who is coming out of the chicken coop flattering angrily with his wings. You won't get the eggs without a fight!
	- 1. Fight these stupid chickens! The crew won't be angry if the stench of rotten eggs is gone.
