- You cast the spell upon the young man and the scroll disintegrates in your hands. You can see how Johns' armor gets completely covered in a shell of rock. [[John]] changes from his cowering position to an upright position as if he has no pain any longer. For a second you doubt the effectiveness of the spell. The spell is not wearing off and [[John]] is still completely covered in stone.
  
  "I am fine this is amazing." The living statue sitting there begins to talk. You are relieved and the tension starts to fade. Both of you begin to laugh and [[John]] jumps up and gives you a hug. "Thank you so much! [[Sara]] have you seen this?"
  
  [[Sara]] was watching the whole time of course. "That was very impressive indeed. That is some powerfull magic you have there my friend."
  
  "I am ready for whatever lies ahead!" [[John]] is clearly in a much better mood than before. These spells from the lizard mage seem to work perfectly fine.
