- You slowly make your way up the ladder. You are almost at the hatch when all of a sudden a huge wave rocks the ship. You barely hold on to the ladder. A huge bang on one of the upper decks indicates that a lot of cargo must have been displaced. But then something weird follows. Soldiers scream and the sound of Weapons hitting flesh thumps through the hatch above you. Then some hasty orders are given.
  
  "Bar the door! The third deck is lost! They must not get onto the second deck or we will all end as fish fodder."
  
  You open the hatch to the second deck. The screaching noise of the rusted hinges cuts through the noise of the waves banging against the ships hull. You seem to be alone in this room. But judging by the noises coming from the next door there are a lot of Magisters preparing for a battle against some sort of enemy.
