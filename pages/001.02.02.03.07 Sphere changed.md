- As you loosen your grip around the sphere the pulse is getting weaker and weaker. You let it slip back inside the bag and you see it flicker one last time before it turns dark. With a crackling sound it turns into a slightly transparent misty stone. As you take the stone out of the bag and hold it against the light you recognize that you are holding a real diamond in your hands. It is a pretty misty one but stillâ€¦ it's a diamond.
  
  You turn back to [[Sara]].
