- Along the center gangway of the ship the bodies of dead soldiers are lying on makeshift beds left and right. This must have been a nightmare for [[Sara]]. Amongst all the dead soldiers you can make out a small creature next to the main mast. He must be a dwarf from the mountains judged by his style of beard and his black colored hair. 
  
  The mountain dwarfs are rumored to be fierce warriors that never back down from a fight. This particular fellow though seems to have lost all his fighting spirit. He lays on his back and you can hear him cry and sob. From time to time he wipes away his tears with two handkerchiefs, as if one would not suffice for all the pain he suffers. You can hear him whimper some words and as you come closer you can make out a couple of words.
  
  "Poor [[Wuffy]] ... all alone... that damn battle... never stood a real chance... now I am blind!"
