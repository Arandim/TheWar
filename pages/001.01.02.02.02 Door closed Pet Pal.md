- "Shu... Shuuhuuu... Shuhuuu!"
  
  You try to imitate the call of an owl. The owl is laying on its back on the chair one wing flapped over its fat belly. Uppon hearing your imitation it stretches its neck just a little bit and looks at you. You can see the two glowing yellow eyes in the dark reflecting the flickering of the lantern in the room staring right at you. It must have seen you. It just sinks back into the chair with a silent "Shuhu... Shu... Shuhuuu... not now you annoying featherless human you. [[Mr. Shuhu]] is too tired to talk right now. Come inside and we can talk but I am not moving one bit. Shu... Shu... go away!" You can't believe your ears. You understood every word the owl said. It must have understand you as well. You whisper silently: "What an unfriendly bird this [[Mr. Shuhu]] . He is too lazy to get to the door."
