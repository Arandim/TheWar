- "That's [[Mr. Shuhu]] my War Owl. He has grown old and for the last couple of days he is so tired and I can't figure out why. I hope that he is not dying down there. But at the moment I can't help him I have to get this ship and all of the remaining survivors to safety. Maybe you could look into that and report back to me. Normally [[Mr. Shuhu]] is quite the hunter and very active. If you believe it or not I even managed to teach him a fire spell. Well after all it might be true what they say about fire magicâ€¦ all you need to be is angry to master it.
