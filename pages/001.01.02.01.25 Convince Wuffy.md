- [[Wuffy]] tilts his head a little bit to his right and looks at you with sad eyes. He sighs loudly and says: "[[Wuffy]] thinks the human is right the dead would want us to have their equipement so that we may have a chance to survive. Please forgive [[Wuffy]] his superstition. 
  
  [[Wuffy]] just can't help it. When the rumbling of this terrible storm and this absurdly loud snoring stops for just a couple of moments [[Wuffy]] hears the screams of the dead coming from that pile of limbs over there. [[Wuffy]] knows that it might sound crazy but he thinks that there is still something captured there. Please maybe you can search it because [[Wuffy]] is far too afraid to do it.
  
  "Sure [[Wuffy]]! I will have a look."
