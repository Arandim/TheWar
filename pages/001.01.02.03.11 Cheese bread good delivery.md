- "Here I got your cheese bread [[Django]]!"
  
  "Ah I was worried you have forgotten me my friend." [[Django]] takes the [[Cheese Bread]] with his strong hands and swallows it in one bite. "Ah that tastes really good! I can taste the proteins pumping in my bloodstream already. 
  
  Thank you! Now about our agreement: I have talked to the whole family and we all agree to a peace treaty. We can't forgive the deeds this monster committed, but we will not disturb him anymore if he stops hunting us. 
  
  And one more thing: I won't forget the part you played in all this if you ever need something just let me know who I have to beat up."
	- 1. "Perfect Django. You made the right decision."
