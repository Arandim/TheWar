- You enter a small room. It appears it is used to store some cargo crates, ooze barrels and a couple of planks. "Maybe to undertake small repairs on the ship while being on duty." In the back of the room a giant beehive hangs down from the wall and it seems the bees already merged their hive a little bit with the piled up planks. The bees are buzzing around very actively and seem quite aggressive. You can smell the scent of sweet honey coming from the beehive. It must be delicious.
	- 1. You decide that it's too dangerous to take the honey out of the beehive without any type of aid or tool. Leave.

	- 2. That honey smells delicious though. I have to get some. Approach the beehive in order to get the honey.
