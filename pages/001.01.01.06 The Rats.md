- The squaking and snoring becomes louder and louder the closer you get to the room. As you enter the small dark room you can see a couple of rats on the floor munching the corn that is coming out of the sacks laying on the floor. A very old rat is snoring loudly but with its eyes wide open. It is awake. You are sure of it. Strange... 
  
  One of the rats is unusally strong built and if you hadn't looked twice you would have thought that it was a cat.
	- 1. Just turn around and leave the room this rat has biceps matching yours in diameter.
