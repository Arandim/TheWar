	- [[Lord Mandir: Mark told you about the beginning of the war against Lord Mandir. What started off as a peaceful seperation of a couple of border counties close to Lord Mandirs city Arx turned into an all out war when he did not accept the outcome of an independence vote from the Empires vassals. Due to an economic crisis, caused by Lord Mandirs efforts to undermine the Empires trading deals with neighboring kingdoms, the Empire was brought to its knees before the war had even started. Soon the Magisters won battle after battle in a brutal war of attrition. After Legion X found out that the enemies were testing some kind of new drug which enhances their fighting force the war council decided to attack Arx. In a desperate attempt to capture Lord Mandir and to end the war the First, Second and Third Legion sailed to Arx for a final battle. But it was already too late. They wittnessed the unleashed power of the new drug first hand when they clashed against The Magisters. Even a surprise attack from Legion X, which blew their cover, could not save the day.]]
