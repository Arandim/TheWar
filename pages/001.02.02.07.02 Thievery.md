- "I knew that we would come to some sort of agreement my friend! Now lets get to buisness. The cook has this nice copper ring with a green gem on top of it. He normally wears it all the time. But since he is blinded it should not be too hard to rid him of that ring. The healer always wears this nice blue necklace. It must be quite expensive I imagine. Back home I could fetch quite a pretty prize for that. The next one is [[John]] he is in possesion of that nice orange copper ring. There must be at least six gems on that thing. Now last but not least the captain. [[Mark]] always wears this nice leather belt around his waist. Just make sure his pants don't drop when you take it. I hope you are practiced when it comes to emptying others peoples pockets my friend. Now go otherwise they start suspecting something if we keep on talking like this."
