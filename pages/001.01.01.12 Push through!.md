- The bees sting you in your wide opened mouth as you continue to scream. Others would have given up long before that. But you are not like others... Like a mechanical contraption you keep on going ignoring the pain. You stick your hand deep inside the beehive thousands of bees sting you, you nearly loose your conciousness. You focus on breathing in deeply to not get knocked out by the poison and inhale a couple of bees. There! You can feel something sticky deep inside the beehive. You grab it firmly and rip your fist out.
  
  An onrush of bees follows your fist out of the beehive and they keep on stinging you. You run away to safety and the few remaining bees eventually stop following you. The majority of bees must have lost their lifes by stinging you. You cower down and scream in agony. You open your fist and look at the honey sticking at your hand... and thousands of dead bees. "Was this really worth the pain?"
