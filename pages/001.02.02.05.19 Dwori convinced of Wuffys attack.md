- [[Dwori]] tries to focus you with his remaining but recently blinded eye and fails miserably. "He attacked you? Is he alive?" 
  
  "I am sorry [[Dwori]] but there was nothing I could do he would not let go of me! I had to kill him. I am so sorry."
  
  [[Dwori]] falls down on his knees. "First [[Mark]] and now you! [[Wuffy]] what has gotten into you?" Teardrops start rolling down his left cheek. You can tell that [[Dwori]] is completely destroyed by the news that his dog is dead. You kneel down to him and give him a friendly hug. He throws his muscular arms around you and cries even more heartbreaking. It takes him what seems to you like an eternity to get a grip of himself again. He blows his nose loudly into one of his handkerchiefs and sits down on his makeshift bed. "He was always such a good dog! I don't know why he was that aggressive since I came back from the battle but I think you might be right. Now he is dead and I will never have the chance to forgive him. Here take one of my handkerchiefs! You have halfed my sorrow and I am only in need of one. If I am to be healed from this terrible curse that has befallen me at that battle you can have my other one as well!  And I suppose I won't need this any time soon. [[Dwori]] hands you over a piece of parchment and with a quick glance you can see that there are multiple recipes for all kinds of different dishes and refreshments. "Maybe you can put them to better useâ€¦ These were Wuffys favourite meals. He was the only one on board this ship who really appreaciated my skills as a cook."
  
  "Thank you [[Dwori]]! Maybe these can help us in the upcoming battle against our pursuers."
