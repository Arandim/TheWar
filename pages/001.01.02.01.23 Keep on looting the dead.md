- You don't care about the dog. It is much more important that you find everything that might help you by looting the dead soldiers. You keep on searching and don't even make out that [[Wuffy]] has moved into an attacking position behind you. You are almost finished with searching every pocket when you hear the faint sound of paws running towards you. You turn around and from the shadows jumps a snarling angry dog towards you. There is no doubt once you see his eyes. He wants to kill you.
