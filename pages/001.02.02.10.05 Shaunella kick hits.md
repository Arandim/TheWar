- The sheep attacks you with remarkable speed.You would have never even dreamed that she would be capable of such fast movement. You try to roll backwards but as you lean back her hoof hits you straight in your face and instead of rolling backwards you fly five feet through the air and crash into the railing. Your vision blurs and you fade away for a couple of seconds. As you wake up you see Marks' face leaning down to you. 
  
  "Are you alright there? That kick hit you pretty hard! Well you should better keep your distance from [[Shaunella]] she can be pretty aggressive. I fear her even more than I fear [[Shaun]] our ram down there." He points towards the lower part of the upper deck. "Well I think you should be fine just don't get close to her any time soon."
