- You slowly make your way up the ladder and hope that the situation on the the upper decks is not as grim as it is on this Meat-Lizard infested deck of death. You open up the hatch to the second deck. The screaching noise of the rusted hinges cuts through the noise of the waves banging against the ships hull. But apart from the unconvenient noise you can make out a couple of Lizard heads snapping towards you direction, fixating you with their glowing eyes. But it seems that they aren't your only problem as a couple of dead soldiers slowly soak up the Source that was spilled on the floor. There is only one way out of this situation.
