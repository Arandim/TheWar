- "Wait a moment!" [[Sara]] holds you back before you get the chance to turn around and leave. "You have had a run in with those nasty bees on the lower deck haven't you?"
  
  "Ahh yes it was most unpleasent but I just could not resist the beautiful smell of their honey."
  
  "Haha I can relate to that! Normally [[John]] takes care of them but now that he is ill he is not even able to stand up from his chair. But let's forget that for a moment. Doesn't it hurt a lot? I mean you are pretty much covered in beestingsâ€¦"
  
  "Yeah sure but I am still breathing so everything is fine."
  
  "Nah come on let me help you! Then I have helped at least someone on this ship." She grabs into her pouch hanging around her waist and pulls out a small vial filled with a red liquid. She opens it with a "PLOPP" and starts to apply the salve on the stings. You instantly feel a lot better and the swelling also starts to disappear.
  
  "Thank you [[Sara]]! That helped a lot!"
  
  "Your welcome!"
