- "Ah you mean [[Wuffy]]. Well he is Dworisâ€¦ I mean our cooks dog. I had to lock him away since he bit me out of the blue when we returned from the battle. Poor [[Dwori]] suffered a terrible fate even though he is alive. He got blinded by a powerfull lightning spell shot directly into his face.
  
   I don't know how he managed to survive that. I would be terrified if magic that powerfull would have hit me. Maybe you can talk to him and ask him how he is doing. [[Sara]] our healer is completely overwhelmed by all the patients she has lost already and could need some help!"
