- You notice the sheep standing right in the middle of the gangway. At first you did not notice it but after double checking you have the feeling that it stares directly at you. From time to time it lowers its head to take another bite of the corn in front of it. Now you are certain that it is indeed staring at you because while it is lowering the head the eyes keep staring at you intently. A cold shiver runs down your spine.
	- 1. Ah this is nothing more than a stubborn sheep just walk past next to it.
