- Dimitry injects the third syringe carefully into the brain of the bug before him. He slowly turns towards you.
  
  "Have you managed to kill that bloody oaf Pierre? Finally I got rid of this useless piece of shit. And now you dare to interrupt me. I have waited a whole week on the Meatbugs to fully grow in order to conduct my experiment. I am going to kill you for this."
  
  Dimitry turns off the machine behind him. One of the Meatbugs that Dimitry injected the liquid into starts to twitch. Its razor sharp claws open and close. Slowly at first but rapidly increasing its speed until a snapping sound indicates its utter lethality. The fourth Meatbug is still sleeping but you have no doubt that the effects of the sedative will wear off soon enough on it too.
  
  "Looks like only one made it. It does not matter. I will crush you!"
