- "Grrrrrâ€¦ Wuff! Wuff! [[Wuffy]] does not like it when the human touches the dead. [[Wuffy]] can still hear their screams sometimes. Put everything back and don't touch them human!
  
  "You can hear their screams [[Wuffy]]? What do you mean? They are dead aren't they?"
  
  "Wuuuff! Sure they are dead but sometimes [[Wuffy]] can still hear them. It is mostly coming from that pile of body parts over there." [[Wuffy]] nods towards a pile of limbs amidst the bodies. You can't make out anything strange there and conclude that [[Wuffy]] must suffer psychologically under his imprisonement down here. With only the dead and a half living statue around to keep ones company anybody would go insane given enough time.
