As you stumble backwards you are showered by a cloud of seawater and you hold your arm protectively in front of your face. Through your fingers you can make out a huge crab in the spray. With magical powers it leaps out of the ocean and lands with a loud crack on top of the deck in front of you. Its huge pincers are snapping together like giant scissors. You already declared war on crabkind and somehow they seem to know. There is only one way out of this mess...
