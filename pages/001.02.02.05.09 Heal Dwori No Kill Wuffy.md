- You cast the spell on [[Dwori]] and a light tone as if someone banged on a gong really hard. A light appears above the dwarf and his eye begins to focus you. He jumps up and you don't recognize the frightend pale dwarf he was before. He seems to have gained all his strength back. He extends his hand and gives you a firm handshake. Then he hand you over his 2nd handkerchief and a piece of wet parchement with a big smile. The parchement must have been stored inside his pockets together with his hande "Just as promised! I am no longer in need of that. All thanks to you! Thank you so much my friend! I thought it would never stop! How is [[Wuffy]] doing?"
