You shall die next to Wuffy's body!" His eyes pierce you like sharp daggers. He really wants to kill you. He pushes you to the side and grabs your hand. He slips off the ring he gave you so that you could talk to [[Wuffy]]. Then he releases you and spits on the deck. "You worthless scum I will destroy you."
