  Marks' eyes are flickering with anger and frustration that he was betrayed by his cook. "Does [[Dwori]] know that you are reporting him?"
  
  "No! I did not tell him anything! I came straight to you!"
  
  "Well done! Then there is still hope for him! Here take the steering wheel I will go and talk to [[Dwori]]."
