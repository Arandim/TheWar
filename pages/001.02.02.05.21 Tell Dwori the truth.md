- [[Dwori]] sits down and closes his blinded eye. After a while he starts talking again. "Yes that sounds like the [[Wuffy]] I knew. May you rest in peace [[Wuffy]]!" He looks up into the direction he guesses you must be. "Thank you for telling me the truth! I suppose I won't need this any time soon. [[Dwori]] hands you over a piece of parchment and with a quick glance you can see that there are multiple recipes for all kinds of different dishes and refreshments. "Maybe you can put them to better useâ€¦ These were Wuffys favourite meals. He was the only one on board this ship who really appreaciated my skills as a cook."
  
  "Thank you [[Dwori]]! Maybe these can help us in the upcoming battle against our pursuers."
