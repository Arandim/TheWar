- Approaching the woman you notice her nimble statue and the determined look of a real hunter in her face. It's carved in ice for eternity it seems. She sits upright. Her hands are resting on her lap. She must be a skilled marksman hitting her targets from afar dodging the arrows of her enemies in her light leather armor. 
  
  "Hello!" Your voice cuts sharply into the ever repeating sound of rumbling waves and shrieking planks. There is no reaction coming from her indicating if she has heard you at all. Not even an eyeblink. Nothing. She just keeps on breathing slowly and you hear a frosty hiss as she inhales and exhales. You sit down next to her and take a deep breath. "This ship is abandoned at least on the lower decks. Time to go upstairs." You stand up wish the lady in ice goodbye and leave.
