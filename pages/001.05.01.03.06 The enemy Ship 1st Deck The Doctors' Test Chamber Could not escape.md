- You enter the bow of the Ship and a grotesque scene unfolds before your eyes. Dimitry, or at least you think this creature must have been Dimitry, lies on the planks and two Meat-Lizards are ripping the flesh from his bones. Beneath Dimitrys' skull lies his cracked syringe and a strange liquid seems to penetrate his fleshless skull. Out of one of Dimitrys' jars that are attached to his belt are crawling some maggots that he must have kept there. They are slowly crawling towards his skull as if they had a clear goal.
