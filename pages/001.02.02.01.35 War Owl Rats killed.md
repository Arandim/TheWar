- "Sir! I managed to take care of the problem haunting your owl. The rats were responsible and I eliminated them in the process."
  
  "Well done! I am glad the rats are finally gone from this ship! Concerning my Owl I am happy to hear he can finally get his rest. I think we might need his skills tomorrow when we fight. Here take this as a reward."
  
  "Thank you Sir!"
