- The easy way to a staff
  I order to protect myself when caught behind enemy lines I have all the spells at my disposal. But from time to time when the enemies got too close I wished I had some means to protect myself in close quarter combat. Therefore I found an easy way of building a staff. Just take a long branch and attach a shell at the tip as some means of channeling and focusing your magic. And that is all there is to now. A simple yet effective way for a spellcaster to protect himself.
