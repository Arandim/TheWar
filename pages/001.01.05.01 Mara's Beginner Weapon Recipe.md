- The easy way to a staff
  I order to protect myself when caught behind enemy lines I have all the spells at my disposal. But from time to time when the enemies got too close I wished I had some means to protect myself in close quarter combat. Therefore I found an easy way of building a staff. 
  
  Just take a long branch and attach a shell and one of the six possible essences at the tip as some means of channeling and focusing your magic. The type of essence you use is crucial for the resulting damage type your handmade staff will output. Here is a short summary of your options:
  
  Fire Essence: Fire Damage
  Air Essence: Air Damage
  Water Essence: Water Damage
  Earth Essence: Earth Damage
  Life Essence: Poison Damage
  Shadow Essence: Physical Damage
  
  And that is all there is to now. A simple yet effective way for a spellcaster to protect himself.
