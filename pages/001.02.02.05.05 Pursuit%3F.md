- "The enemy is whaaaat?" 
  
  [[Dwori]] jumps on his feet. You are astonished by his speed even though he is blind. In a blink of an eye he has his daggers drawn. One in each hand pointing them towards you. His back is pressed against the planks behind him.
  
  "I am ready! Where are they? "
  
  "Relax [[Dwori]] they are a couple of miles behind us. But they are slowly catching up with us. [[Mark]] estimates they will be upon us by tomorrow noon."
  
  [[Dwori]] slides back down on the deck. He lets out a big sigh.
  
  "Ahhh! I could not have fought in my condition anyway! I mean I can't even see my own hand in front of me! Wait so when they will be attacking tomorrow you still have plenty of time to prepare as you said right? Here this might help! He hands over a piece of parchment with some notes scribbled on it.
  
  "This might come in handy. I wrote down a discovery I made when I had to fight my way out of the kitchen. I will never forget the day when those damn pirates almost took our ship..."
  
  "Thank you [[Dwori]]! That was exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for! That can help us a lot in the upcoming battle."
