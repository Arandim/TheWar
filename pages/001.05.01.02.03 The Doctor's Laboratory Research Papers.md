	- Topic: Mind Maggots general information
		- Mind Maggots are between 15cm to 20cm long grey colored worms who latch onto their prey and control them through some sort of mind meld. The effect is short but often long enough to cause enough harm to the victim. Mind Maggots possess a strange life cycle. When they are born they share a mind bond with their mother, doing her every bidding. Once the mother dies they loose this connection and gain their free will. The same happens to the next generation. They seem to be quite resilient to any kind of poison or physical damage to their body. Their life expectancy is 25 years in average. They seem to possess above average intelligence to comparable worm-like species.

		- The list goes on and you flick through at least a hundred pages until the entries stop and a result is scribbled down.
			- Summary: No successfull introduction of a Source infused Mind Maggot to the frontal cortex of a common house cat could be achieved within 947 attempts. The specimen dies after approximately 73 hours. Most common cause of death: Infection.
			- Personal Note: It seems I have hit a dead end in my research. I have to unwind and will accept the invitation of Vasili, my old friend from the University of Medicine in Arx. Nikolai my old roommate will join us during the holiday.

	- Topic: Integrating the Mind Maggot to the immune system of the Meatbug Embryo
	- Credit:
		- To Dr. Vasili at the Institute of Embryology at the Medical University in Arx for discovering the possibility to integrate an allogeneic transplant into the immune system of a representative specimen of the same breed
		- To Dr. Nikolai at the Institute of Biology at the Natural Science Institute of Applied Biology in Arx for discovering the genetic relatedness of Mind Maggots to Meatbugs
	- Specimen: Meatbug
	  Size: 52cm
	  Incubation time before the procedure: 5d
	  Description of the procedure: Insertion of a Source infused Mind Maggot to the egg sac of a freshly incubated Meatbug egg. The Mind Maggot instinctively latches on the part of the Embryo where the brain is developing at a later stage. There are no noteworthy observations until the hatching detectable.
	  Result: Complete control of the Meatbug via the Mind Maggots' mother offspring inside of its frontal cortex. The Mind Maggots' mother stays in the possession of the operator and enables him to control multiple Meatbugs at once.

	- Topic: Metamorphosis of the mind controlled Meatbug by Source consumption
	- Credit: To my assistent Borisov for accidently feeding one of the mind controlled Meatbugs some Source
	- Result: After the consumption of Source the Meatbug underwent a strange Metamorphosis. This is undocumented until now and Dr. Nikolai confirmed that this is indeed the first case. Within seconds after the consumption the Meatbugs' shell cracked open and some sort of Lizard crept out of its body. This creature proofed to be much stronger than the Meatbugs. Even in it's early stage it almost cracked the steel cage in the laboratory and tried to kill Borisov. Its aggressiveness is impressive, but therein lies the problem. It not only seems to get stronger physically but also mentally. It can resist the control of the Mind Maggot inside it's brain and the connection fluctuates from non existant to fully intact. After 52 trials I had to quit this project with the same result.
	- Personal Note: I have to find some way of increasing the strength of the Mind Maggot before the Metamorphosis in order to have complete control over this new Meat-Lizard.

	- Topic: Increasing the Mind Maggots strength inside the frontal cortex of the Meatbug
	- Description of the procedure: Injection of distilled Source inside the frontal cortex of the Meatbug close to the inserted Mind Maggot
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by cerebral hemorrhage
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by ceisure
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by euthanasia after unexpected metamorphosis
	  Note: It seems the correct dosage is crucial to prevent an early metamorphosis
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 4,5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by stroke
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 4,5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by ceisure
	- Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 4,5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Death by euthanasia after unexpected metamorphosis
	  Note: Dosage is still too high
	- After dozens of pages:
	  Anesthetics: Chloroform introduced via intubation
	  Injected ml of distilled Source: 1,5ml
	  Access Point: Os frontale
	  Result: Suffering for 76 hours then stabilizing of vital parameters
	  Note: The Meatbug seems to be much more responsive than before the procedure
		- Result: After 156 failed Injections the most common cause for failure was too high dosage with 40,6% followed closely by cerebral hemorrhage with 37,4% caused by incorrect insertion of the injection needle. Another cause for failure were seizures during the procedure which caused 17,6% of deaths. The remaining 4,4% were either successes (1,5%) or deaths caused by a stroke (2,9%).

	- Topic: improvement of the Injection procedure
		- Result: After another 89 Injections and rigorous protocols a success rate of 45,1% has been achieved.
- Date: 15th of December 1582Ea
	- Topic: Metamorphosis after the Injetion of 1,5ml distilled Source inside the frontal cortex of a Mind Maggot possessed Meatbug
		- Result: Feeding Source to the injected Meatbug resulted in the expected Metamorphosis. But the connection is still not strong enough to take complete control of the Meat-Lizard. It broke free after a couple of minutes of successful mind control and ripped Borisovs' left arm off. The specimen had to receive euthanasia. After the euthanasia the Mind Maggot started to form a what is best described as a Flesh Mob out of the lifeless remains of the Meat-Lizard. This construct proofed to be quite the formidable adversary, and almost killed two members of the security team. This could be the breakthrough I was hoping for.

	- Topic: Funding for further research halfed
		- Personal note: The war is eating up all the resources. It has been like that for the past four years but until now it only affected the regions up north and the citizens of Arx were pretty much unaffacted with the exception of a shortage of a specific good here and there or the occasional prize increase. But today the war finally reached me. The funding for my project has been cut in half. I have to deliver results otherwise my project is finished. The human testing phase has to be launched, no matter the cost. I just struggle to find suitable candidates for the procedure. Maybe joining the war effort might provide me with the specimens I need to finish my research.

	- Topic: Joining the Magisters
		- Personal Note: Vasili and Nikolai convinced me to apply to the Magisters' research team. Their projects got a big boost in funding once they found a way to weaponize their work. It shouldn't be too hard for me to do the same.
- Date: 29th of January 1582Ea
	- Topic: The Magisters' Research Division
		- Personal Note: After the application to the Research Division I provided them with all the details of my research and taught them how to perform the procedures I painfully discovered over the years. All within less than a week. Needless to say they were more than impressed. I secured more than triple the funding I got before, supplemented by a very generous personal salary. In exchange I have to report all of my research directly to the Bureau of War Research in Arx. Even Lord Mandir took personal interest in my research and was impressed by the results I had achieved so far. Given enough time, I might even get access to higher grade top secret research projects.
- Date 8th of April 1582Ea
	- Topic: The devastating attack of the Legionnaires
		- Personal Notes: The Legionnaires attacked Arx today. We scrambled every last soldier to stop them but in the end we just weren't enough. Lord Mandir had to execute Order 31. This made the difference. But at what cost?
- Date 10th of April 1582Ea
	- Topic: Order 31
		- Personal Notes: We could not help those affected by Order 31. It was the Research Divisions' task to find the most effective neutralization protocol. I am grateful for the service of the Order of White Magisters who executed the protocol. I don't think I would have been capable of doing so myself.
- Date 11th of April 1582Ea
	- Topic: New orders
		- Personal Notes: I have new orders from high command. I am to sail with the Endurance under Captain Clover. Our primary objective is to pursue and silence a remaining force of Legionnaires who escaped commandeering the Lady Vengeance. If I have understood Captain Clover correctly we have a good chance of catching up because the Lady Vengeance is a much older build and far slower than the Endurance. I hope Clovers' assumptions are correct and we are able to catch them in time. The enemy can't learn about our momentary weakness. Additionally I hope we can make some prisoners because our secondary objective is to progress my research, especially now after Order 31. I have had the opportunity to learn so much about how Source affects humans. I am confident that this experience alone is worth more than five years of research on the Meatbugs. Given proper experimenting this knowledge can be harnessed and turned into a great weapon for the Magisters. I am even willing to go so far as to say that this might be the turning point we have been waiting for during this endless war.
