  Topic: Mind Maggots general information
  
  Mind Maggots are between 15cm to 20cm long grey colored worms who latch onto their prey and control them through some sort of mind meld. The effect is short but often long enough to cause enough harm to the victim. Mind Maggots possess a strange life cycle. When they are born they share a mind bond with their mother doing her every bidding. Once the mother dies they loose this connection and gain their free will. The same happens to the next generation. They seem to be quite resilient to any kind of poison or physical damage to their body. Their life expectancy is 25 years. They seem to possess above average intelligence to comparable worm-like species.
