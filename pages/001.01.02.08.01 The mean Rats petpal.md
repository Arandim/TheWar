- You keep watching the rats from the shadows. Amidst their squeaking you can definetly make out a couple of words. "This dumb rat family... hoarding all the food in their corner. If it weren't for that strong fellow..." Another rat is skreaking: "Nothing to eat! I swear I'll eat anything! A shame that the dog is guarding the dead humans... They would have made a nice supper. Ahh " Another one is answering in a lower skreaking voice: "Maybe one of them wakes up and is still tired I'd hava no problem with some fresh meat... One quick bite in the throat is all it needs..."
	- 1. You are sure that these rats want to kill you. Either you sneak past them and avoid a fight at least for now or you surprise them and kill them on the spot.
