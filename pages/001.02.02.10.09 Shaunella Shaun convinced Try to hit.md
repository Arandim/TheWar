- As you approach [[Shaunella]] you are welcomed by her good mood and her happy face. She greets you with a happy "Määähhh! I am so happy to see you again and I am so sorry about earlier. I was so mean to you. I am just a little bit shy you know! [[Shaun]] told me everything about you. Impressive how you handled the rat problem! Well I have heard everything the captain said before so I know about the dangers that await us. But don't worry I will tell [[Shaun]] that he should fight by your side. He will join you in the upcoming fight, he never backs down from a good fight. I am afraid I am of no use in a fight so I might just wait on the lower decks until the fighting is done."
  
  "Thank you [[Shaunella]]! We could definitly need Shauns' strength in that fight. And thanks for the milk."
