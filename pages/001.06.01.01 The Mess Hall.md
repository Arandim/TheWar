- Despite all odds, you have been victorius on the upper deck. But there is little time to celebrate your victory. You can hear hush whispering voices coming from the lower deck. Judging by the whispering noises there must be at least ten soldiers down there. You carefully descend the stairs that lead down to the mess hall. There seems to be nobody here, but you can make out heavy footsteps and voices coming from the doors to your left and right. It would seem that they are ready for a fight. In between the screaching of wooden planks and the rumbling of waves against the ship you overhear some parts of a conversation.
  
  "...be ready to destroy all our food supplies when they show up..."
  "...don't hesitate to destroy any evidence of the captains orders... just like Captain Clover told us to do if something happend to him! And spread out! Your team comes to our aid if we are on the brink of loosing to them allright? Let's give them hell!"
  
  Maybe you can get yourself into a better position to interrupt the destruction of food supplies by sneaking closer towards the Magister who is responsible for their destruction.
