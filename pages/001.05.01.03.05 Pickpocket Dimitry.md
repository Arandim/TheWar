- You carefully search Dimitry's pockets until you have everything you need. You then decide to...
	- 1. Position yourself properly before you attack him.
		- 001.05.01.03.05.01 Attack Dimitry after pickpocketing
			- One Bug (Sleepy Meatbug) will always survive at this point because he is not yet injected. But he can't transform like the injected bugs upon death.
			- Will Dimitry's Bugs survive? GM has to roll a D20 for each of the three injected Bugs. Target: 12
				- SKILL CHECK
					- GM has to roll a D20 and add the specified Modifier
						- IF GM rolls higher or equal than the required threshold THEN
							- Bug survives and joins the fight
						- IF GM rolls lower than the required threshold THEN
							- Bug dies and can't join the fight. GM has to kill the Bug he rolled for.
			- IF one Bug survives
				- To Vignette [[001.05.01.03.01 One Bug joins the fight]]
			- IF two Bugs survive
				- To Vignette [[001.05.01.03.02 Two Bugs join the fight]]
			- IF three Bugs survive
				- To Vignette [[001.05.01.03.03 Three Bugs join the fight]]
	- 2. Sneak past by him, letting him finish his experiment. You must find the rest of your equipement before you feel ready to attack him. You have to take the risk that he might have injected and stabilized all the meatbugs by then.
