- You have searched every corner of your cell. Apart from some useless junk you can't find anything that could help you escape from this place. Pierre still sits upright on his stool, trying to ignore you as good as he can. You can make out a movement in the shadows at the top of the stairs where Dimitry and Clover left the cabin. There! There was definitly a huge rat. This must be the rat from the Lady Vengeance. You don't know how he managed to escape the Magisters but maybe he could be your way out of this prison.
