- You have searched every corner of your cell. Apart from some useless junk you can't find anything that could help you escape from this place. Pierre still sits upright on his stool, trying to ignore you as good as he can. 
  
  You can make out a movement in the shadows at the top of the stairs where Dimitry and Clover left the cabin. There! There was definitly a huge rat. This must be the rat from your ship. You don't know how it managed to escape the Magisters but maybe it could be your way out of this prison.
- 1. Wait a couple of minutes, then focus your attention on the rat and try to lure it towards you..
