- [[Django]] gives you a critical look. "Forgiveness you say? After all this monster has done to my family?" His muscular arms are twitching and you can see how his core tightens. Then he sighs and suddenly all his anger and frustration which was clearly visible in his posture is blown away. It gives away to an emotional fragile, sad and depressed pose. 
  
  "Youâ€¦ you are right." He looks up to you with tears in his eyes. "Nothing will bring back my little babies." On his face appears a shimmer of hope. "What if you would talk to the beast. I mean I clearly can't do it because he would kill me on sight. But you, you could talk to him and maybe he agrees to stop the hunt. 
  
  If he agrees to a truce or even agrees to meet me in order to negotiate a peace treaty I would be willing to let him sleep. What do you think? Would you be so kind to talk to him on my behalf?"
