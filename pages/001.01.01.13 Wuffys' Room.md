- You open the door and it swings open with a screeching sound. Now that you don't have to look through the iron bars anymore you are able to make out a lot of details in the room. In the poorly lit background of the room there are piled up corpses of soldiers and body parts of fallen comrades. The battle must have been horrible. 
  
  There are blood stains everywhere and the attempt to wash them away failed miserably. In the middle of the room facing towards you and the entrance is a desk that flows over with papers, books and all kinds of writings. The lizard woman sitting at the desk is turned into a living statue. She wears a light robe and has two wands marking her as a mage. 
  
  A brown labrador is standing next to her as if he was on the lookout for intruders who might harm her. You also notice his protective stance towards the fallen soldiers and you do not dare to touch them. Next to the desk is a huge bookcase which is quelling over with books. The whole scene is lit by a candle at the desk and the braziers next to the door you just entered.
