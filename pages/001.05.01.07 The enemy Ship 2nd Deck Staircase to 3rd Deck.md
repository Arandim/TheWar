- Finally! You have beaten all your opponents. Just as you step on the staircase to get to the 3rd Deck a bloodcurling rumble shakes the ship to its core. you tremble and fall as you are thrown forward by the significant reduction in speed that the ship must have sustained. Did you hit a reef? It can't be! Not this far out on the sea. 
  
  Suddenly the ships hull groans and the planks seem to burst under an immense pressure from the outside. You start to panik and run up the staircase. There is fire on the third deck and something entirely different. Tentacles!? Huge tentacles poking through the hull of the ship left port and starboard likewise. You can't believe your eyes. The creature that belongs to those tentacles must be gigantic in size, even bigger than the whole ship. It is time to get out of here! But behind the flames you can make out faint hissing noises and the waddling sound of multiple feet obviously belonging to Meat-Lizards is coming from behind the left and right door in the cabins next to you. If you want to get out of here alive you will have to fight your way through. At least they did not spot you yet and you have the element of surprise on your side.
