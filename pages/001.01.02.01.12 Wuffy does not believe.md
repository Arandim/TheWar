- [[Wuffy]] stares at you. Then suddenly he starts to growl. " [[Wuffy]] does not believe a word the human has told him! [[Wuffy]] thinks Master [[Dwori]] is in danger and you collaborate with this [[Mark]] fellow to harm Master [[Dwori]]. This room nextdoors is not good for resting it is a prison cell just like the room [[Wuffy]] is kept in." After [[Wuffy]] finished his sentence he starts to bark angrily. [[Dwori]] must have heard that!
  
  "What are you doing with my dog?" Dworis angry voice rumbles through the belly of the ship. "I did not want to use these powers ever again but you are forcing my hand you bastard!"
  
  All of a sudden you see some of the dead paladins rise up, as if someone was commanding them. [[Wuffy]] comes running at you with a deep growl!

				- [[Wuffys meal: Wuffy saw through your deception and knows that you tried to manipulate him in believing that Dwori is just resting nextdoors. As a result Wuffy attacked you. Dwori hearing the rukkus raised some of the dead Paladins with his old necromantic powers to aid his dog in combat. You had to kill everyone in self defence. Only time will tell what happens to Dwori once you reach the capital.]]
