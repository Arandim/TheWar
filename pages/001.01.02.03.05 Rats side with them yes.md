- As you kneel before [[Django]] you can feel that he is touched by your gesture as he wipes away a small tear and starts to speak in a very serious and loud voice:
  
  "I [[Django]] "Destroyer of Cheese" hereby accept your offer. We shall fight together and we shall die together! When you are ready to kill the beast and have the key to his cabin approach me once more and we shall take our revenge!"
  
  You can hear his loud voice echoing in the belly of the ship and you can hear an angry voice "Shuuhuu! I have heard everything here nextdoors and know this you pesky rats: Siding with a human won't help you I will defend my life until the last drop of my blood is spilled! I will attack anyone coming in here! And now let me sleep in peace I have to digest!"
  
  You know now that you have made yourself an enemy.
- 1. You bid the rats farewell and tell them you will contact them once you have the key and you are ready.
