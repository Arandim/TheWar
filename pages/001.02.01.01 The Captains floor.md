- As you run up the stairs small gaps between the wooden planks let a couple of sunbeams through. They shine in your face and you can feel the warmth outside. You grab the old doorhandle and open the door with a grinding sound coming from the old hinges. The bright daylight blinds you as you try to cover your eyes with one hand. The wind ruffles up your hair and you breath in deeply.
  
  You can smell the wooden planks benath your feet and the clean air of the open sea. But the wind coming from starboard carries a scent of rotten eggs with it. You also smell a slight scent of iron as if a lot of blood has been spilled and not been washed away for days. As your eyes get used to the sparkling sun you see the top deck of the ship in all its glory. 
  
  Around you there is nothing else but wood and then ocean as far as you can see. A strong, broad-shouldered man is standing at the steering wheel. He grabs it with a firm grip taming the sea as the breeze is quite strong. He must have heard the screaming sound of you opening the door because he lets go of the steering wheel with one hand and turns around to you. 
  
  "Finally! You are awake!" His deep voice rumbles like the storm behind you over the ships bridge but he sounds genuinely friendly. "Come here soldier! I was hoping you'd wake up!" You slowly approach the man and identify him as a high ranking officer of the imperial army. At least the multiple insignias on his golden shoulderpads indicate that his rank must be pretty high. His white hair is tied back and the white beard is well groomed. His green eyes pierce through you like a pair of daggers. His years of experience represent themselves in his harsh facial features. His high forehead is covered with wrinkels and burnt by the sun indicating his exposition to the harsh life of a soldier who doesn't care about the comfort of a life as a nobleman. You can tell by his cavernous cheeks that he must have endured many battles and pain beyond the limits of mortal men. 
  
  As your eyes wander down you find a meticulously maintained plate armor that fits the officer perfectly. His upper extremities are covered by plated armguards and fine lamellar iron forged gloves. His chest armor continues down over his waste giving him good protection. The armor ends with a loincloth colored in blue with the golden coat of arms of the imperial houses stiched into it. The legs are completely packed in plate armor as well. Well oiled hinges at the joints are silently performing their duty as he moves with utter surety that he is going to overcome any threat. He looks you directly in the eye and asks: "Which legion were you serving in?"
	- 1. You look down to the wooden planks avoiding his eyes. "I can't remember anything!"
