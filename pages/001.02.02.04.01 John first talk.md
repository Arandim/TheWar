- You step closer to the young man cowering on the chair. He is whimpering in agony. He does not even notice you.
  
  "Hello there what's your name?"
  
  The man flinches as he is obviously surprised by your presence. He makes a small effort to turn his upper body around to face you and grunts in pain: "Hi there I am [[John]]. I am the [[1st Lieutenant]]."
  
  "What happend to you?"
  
  "I have no idea! A couple of days after the battle it started like a seasickness which I am normally immune to. But it quickly worsened so much that I became that hopeless bundle of pain you are witnessing right now."
  
  He looks up to you and you can see the pain that he must have endured in the last couple of days. It left deep marks on him. His eyes turned to a yellowish color and his skin tone changes from time to time from a completely pale tone to the same yellowish one in his eyes.
