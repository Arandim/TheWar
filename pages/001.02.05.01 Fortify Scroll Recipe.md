- Fortify:
  While Allie focused on perfecting the Armor of Frost spell I was set on cheating my way through the exams with the help of the scrolls. I was already learning about a new way to regenerate physical armor. The spell somehow flows into the scales, plates or the fabric depending on what armor type you are wearing and weaves them back together. The weaving progress appears like you are covered entirely in a shell made out of rock. If that isn't amazing enough it also heals your target instantly from various diseases.
  
  I discovered that if you let the paper absorb an earth essence and add whisperwood at the exact same time it somehow fuses together into the paper and the lower body of a figurelike shadow appears on the paper with small markings on his pants that somehow add up to the magic words you have to speak in order to perform the spell. For all I know it works like a charm.
