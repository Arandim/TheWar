- Your call to Django almost gets swallowed by Pierres' loud snoring.
  
  But Django must have heard you because he silently slips under Pierre's stool moving closer to your cell. His big muscular shadow flickers in the candlelight as he struggles to squeeze his upper body through the iron bars of your cell.
  
  "You need my help, friend?" Django must remember that you helped him on board the Lady Vengeance.
  
  "Yes Django, indeed I am in need of your assistance. It would be most helpful if you could open our cell by using the lever in front of it."
  
  "Nothing easier than that, watch me..." Django slips through the iron bars and scuttles towards the lever. He operates the heavy lever with ease and the door unlocks with a loud click. You are free.
  
  "I think you will need further assistance if you want to get off this ship." Django seems to offer you his help.
  
  "We are glad that you are willing to help us Django but don't you have a family to take care of?"
  
  "They remained on the other ship. I hope they found a way off the ship after the magisters burned it. I couldn't do anything for them then, but maybe I can avenge them now. That's surely what they would want me to do!"
  
  "In that case we gladly accept your assistance."
