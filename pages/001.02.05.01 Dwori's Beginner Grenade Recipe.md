  The day the pirates attacked our ship I was down in the kitchen preparing some food. They took me completely by surprise and surrounded me. All I had was my kitchen knife and my wits. The wits were what saved me that day. We were transporting valuable goods from the Lizards to the capital and some of it was stored in the kitchen. The strange glow that was coming from the cargo bags interested me from the day we received the shipment. In my desperation I opened one of the bags and it was filled with glowing mushrooms. I have no idea why they were glowing and what these Lizards use them for but I had another more dwarvish idea. I took an empty canister and put the Jellyroom (I later found out that this is how they call these Mushrooms) inside. When I shook the canister it began to crackle from the inside and it seemed that the glowing intensified. When I threw this grenade at the pirates it exploded with a loud burst and the enemies where blinded for quite some time. I could easily overwhelm them because they nearly missed all their strikes. When I think about it know I was lucky they were all melee combatants because a mage would have easily destroyed me with his area of effect spells.
