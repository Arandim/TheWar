- "Shu... Shuuhuuu...
  Shuhuuu!"
  
  You try to imitate the call of an owl. The owl is laying on its back on the chair one wing flapped over its fat belly. Uppon hearing your imitation it stretches its neck just a little bit and looks at you. You can see the two glowing yellow eyes in the dark reflecting the flickering of the lantern in the room staring right at you. It must have seen you. It lays back in the chair and closes its eyes. For a moment you imagine that the owl is rubbing its fat belly with one wing but then the movement stops.
