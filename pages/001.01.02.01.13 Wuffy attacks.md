- [[Wuffy]] stares at you. Then suddenly he starts to growl and bark angrily. [[Dwori]] must have heard that!
  
  "What are you doing with my dog?" Dworis angry voice rumbles through the belly of the ship. "I did not want to ever use these powers again but you are forcing my hand you bastard!"
  
  All of a sudden you see how some of the dead paladins around you rise up as if someone was commanding them to. [[Wuffy]] comes running at you with a deep growl!
